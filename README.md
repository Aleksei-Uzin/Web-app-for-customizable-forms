## Business Logic

## Requirements

- should support two languages (English and any other). Only UI is translated, not the user content

- should support two visual themes (skins): light and dark (the user selects one and the choice is saved)

## Technical Stack

- _CSS framework_: Tailwind CSS [link](https://tailwindcss.com/)
